# Monopoly
This project is an implementation of the classic Monopoly game in Python and allows multiple people to play a text-based version of the game together. Soon, I'll be adding a GUI and the ability to play against an AI for more fun! I built this game to improve my Python, OOP skills, and project management skills.
